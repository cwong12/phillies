README: Phillies R&D Questionnaire
Christopher Wong

My answer to part a) is included in a pdf, "Phillies_Questions.pdf", along with
an example of a visualization produced by my part b) program

For part b) I wrote a Python program "phillies_quest.py" using Python 3.7 and can be run from the command
line. The program scrapes the relevant salary data using BeautifulSoup and puts
the data in a pandas dataframe. After calculating the qualifying offer value from the
dataframe, it prints out the results as well as using matplotlib to graph a histogram
of all the contract data, highlighting the top 125 contracts by dollar value and again showing
the qualifying offer value.
